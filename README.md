# 📢 **News Classification with Machine Learning**   
🎯 Classifying newspaper articles based on their categories using ML models.


## 📌 Project Overview  
This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to classify news articles into different categories. By analyzing text-based features, the model learns patterns and assigns the correct category to new, unseen articles.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Multi-class classification for various news categories  
✅ Text preprocessing & feature engineering (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, etc.)  
✅ Comparison of ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
✅ Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
✅ Scalable & extendable for real-world use
